# 🚀 Document Upload & CV Query Enhancement

## ✅ Issues Fixed & Features Added

### 🔧 **Bug Fixes:**
1. **Fixed 'doc_title' Error**: Resolved the KeyError that was causing "Error processing request: 'doc_title'" 
   - Added both `title` and `doc_title` fields to search results for backward compatibility
   - Ensured consistent field naming across the application

### 🎯 **New Features:**

#### 1. **Collapsible Document-Specific Query Section**
- **Location**: Below the main question input area
- **Visibility**: Only appears when a document is uploaded
- **Functionality**: 
  - Expandable/collapsible section with smooth animations
  - Shows current uploaded document name
  - Provides dedicated buttons for document-specific queries

#### 2. **Separate Query Buttons**
- **📄 Ask from Document**: Searches ONLY within the uploaded document
- **🌐 Ask from All Sources**: Searches the entire corpus (default behavior)
- **Smart Loading Messages**: Different loading messages based on query mode

#### 3. **Enhanced UI/UX**
- **Collapsible Design**: Clean, space-efficient interface
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear icons and status messages
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on different screen sizes
- **Contextual Information**: Shows which document is being queried

### 🎨 **UI Components Added:**

#### **CSS Classes:**
```css
.doc-specific-section     /* Main collapsible container */
.section-header          /* Clickable header with toggle icon */
.collapsible-content     /* Expandable content area */
.toggle-icon            /* Animated arrow icon */
.doc-info-text          /* Document information display */
.doc-buttons            /* Button container */
```

#### **JavaScript Functions:**
```javascript
toggleDocSpecificSection()    // Toggle collapse/expand
askFromDocument()            // Query uploaded document only
askFromAll()                // Query all sources
askQuestionWithMode()       // Unified query handler
```

### 🔄 **User Workflow:**

1. **Upload Document**: User uploads PDF (e.g., CV, policy document)
2. **Section Appears**: Collapsible section becomes visible
3. **Choose Query Mode**:
   - **Main Button**: "Get Answer" → searches all sources
   - **Document Button**: "Ask from Document" → searches uploaded doc only
   - **All Sources Button**: "Ask from All Sources" → explicit all-sources search

### 📊 **Technical Implementation:**

#### **Backend Changes:**
- Enhanced `/ask` endpoint to handle `focus_on_uploaded_doc` parameter
- Improved search filtering for document-specific queries
- Better error handling and result formatting

#### **Frontend Changes:**
- Added collapsible section with smooth animations
- Implemented mode-based query system
- Enhanced document management UI
- Improved user feedback and loading states

### 🎯 **Benefits:**

1. **Focused Queries**: Users can ask questions specifically about their uploaded documents
2. **Better UX**: Clear separation between general and document-specific searches
3. **Space Efficient**: Collapsible design keeps interface clean
4. **Flexible**: Users can choose their preferred search scope
5. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of what's being searched

### 🚀 **Current Status:**
- ✅ **Web App Running**: http://localhost:8092
- ✅ **All Features Working**: Upload, collapse, document-specific queries
- ✅ **Error Fixed**: No more 'doc_title' errors
- ✅ **UI Enhanced**: Better document management interface

### 💡 **Usage Example:**
