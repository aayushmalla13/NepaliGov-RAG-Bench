- **Process questions**: "How do I apply for a license?"
- **Factual questions**: "What is the minimum age for voting?"
- **Comparison questions**: "What are the differences between private and public sector jobs?"

### Why am I getting no results?

Common reasons for no results:
- **Query too specific**: Try broader terms
- **Query too vague**: Be more specific
- **Language mismatch**: Try the other language
- **Topic not covered**: The topic might not be in the document corpus

**Solutions:**
- Rephrase your question
- Use different keywords
- Try the suggested quick questions
- Check if the topic is covered in government documents

### How accurate are the search results?

The system typically achieves:
- **90%+ search relevance** for well-formed queries
- **95%+ OCR accuracy** for clear documents
- **85%+ translation quality** (BLEU score)
- **90%+ user satisfaction** based on feedback

### Can I upload my own documents?

Yes, you can upload PDF documents through the web interface. The system will:
1. Process the document using OCR
2. Extract text and create embeddings
3. Add it to the searchable corpus
4. Make it available for queries

## üåê Language and Translation

### Which languages are supported?

Currently supported:
- **English**: Full support for queries and responses
- **Nepali**: Full support for queries and responses
- **Mixed content**: Documents with both languages

### How does translation work?

The system uses:
- **MarianMT**: Primary translation service
- **Google Translate**: Fallback service (if available)
- **Quality assessment**: Automatic quality scoring
- **Context awareness**: Government-specific terminology

### Why are some translations awkward?

Translation quality depends on:
- **Document complexity**: Technical documents are harder to translate
- **Context**: Government terminology requires specialized knowledge
- **Language pairs**: English-Nepali translation is still evolving

**Solutions:**
- Try rephrasing your question
- Use simpler language
- Ask in the original document language
- Provide feedback to improve translations

### Can I get answers in both languages?

Yes! The system can provide:
- **Bilingual responses**: Answers in both English and Nepali
- **Source language**: Answers in the original document language
- **Preferred language**: Answers in your preferred language

## üìä Technical Questions

### How does the search work?

The system uses:
1. **Semantic Search**: Vector similarity search using FAISS
2. **Embeddings**: Transformers-based text embeddings
3. **Ranking**: Multiple factors including relevance, quality, and recency
4. **Filtering**: Document type, authority, and language filtering

### What is the processing pipeline?

The system follows a 12-stage checkpoint architecture:
1. **CP1**: Authority detection
2. **CP2**: Document type classification
3. **CP3**: OCR processing
4. **CP4**: Vector storage
5. **CP5**: Semantic search
